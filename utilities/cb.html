        <h1>Chromebook Utilities</h1>
        <h2>Dedicated to helping people bypass restrictions on specifically the Chromebook.</h2>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h1 id="extensions">Extensions</h1>
            <h2>Disabling extensions</h2>
            <p>This isn't too hard to do. Though, it is only possible to <b>temporarily</b> disable them.<br>According
                to others around, it may not work for everyone (it works for me)</p>
            <h3>How to do it</h3>
            <nl>
                <li>1. Copy and paste this into the address
                    bar:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chrome://restart</code></li>
                <li>2. Press enter.</li>
            </nl>
            <p>It will restart your chromebook and keep you logged in which restarts extensions so it makes it spend
                time
                to reload.<br>
                You can also do this
                URL:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chrome://inducebrowsercrashforrealz</code><br>
                It will crash your chromebook which just restarts it.
                <br><br>
                Tested on the LineWize extension so far.
            </p>

            <h2>Method 2</h2>
            <p>This may not work for all extensions and chromebooks but it might.</p>
            <p>Type <code>chrome://inspect/#extensions</code> into the address bar and press enter.<br>
                Find the extension(s) you want to disable.<br>
                Click “inspect”. There will be a series of tabs on the top. Click “console”.<br>
                Then, at the bottom there is a type pad. Write down: <code>window.close(true)</code> THEN BOOM.<br>
                It’s gone.<br><br>To reverse this, restart your computer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Inspect extensions</h2>
            <p>I don't know why this would be useful and it may not work for everyone is dev tools is disabled but you
                can inspect some chrome extensions.<br>
                To do it, copy and paste this into the address bar and press
                enter:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chrome://inspect/#extensions</code></p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h2>Secret settings</h2>
            <p>I randomly stumbled across this. It lets you do modify some secret settings.<br>
                <b>Hint: If <code>chrome://settings</code> or other things such as that URL are blocked by an extension,
                </b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>To do this, enter <code>chrome://flags</code></p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h2>Secret terminal/command line (crosh)</h2>
            <p>Crosh is the terminal/command line for Chromebooks.<br>
                To do it...</p>
            <nl>
                <li>1. Press <code>ctrl+alt+t</code> on the chromebook.</li>
            </nl>
            <p>This is the shortcut for opening crosh.<br><br>
                Your school will likely try to block it by automatically closing it.<br>
                There is a way around this though.<br><br>
                You know how you can drag tabs around on chrome to reposition them?<br>
                Crosh opens up like a tab. Simply click and drag that tab as fast<br>
                as you can before it closes. You'll get used to it.<br>
                Bam! Now you can do things such as powerwashing/rollbacking your chromebook! (Setting chromebook to a
                previous version/update)</p>
