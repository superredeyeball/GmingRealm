### Welcome to Gmingrealm, the best gaming site on the market!


This project has a license, so don't try copying it. You can fork it and give credit without claiming it's yours. Self-hosting and hosting providers are OK ***WITH CREDIT AND LICENSE*** of me (SuperBlueEyeball) and the template creator (SipSup3314). 

## My backstory 

I used to have this gaming site hosted on replit, but it run on replit which sucks now. Replit also got blocked in my school. The site even got resource limited so I took initiative after a while and restarted the best gaming site ever!!!

## Features

This site has a few features to make your life easier:
- Tab Hider (Opens tab in about:blank. Not visible to <em>some</em> extensions such as GoGuardian)
- Homepage is disguised as Google
>(We may add more options in the settings to change stuff like this in the future.

## Requests / Ideas / Bugs

To make a game request or review the site, please [tell me in my feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU1CELhxTF7WqrW2ujKs9DHI1gANNJQqzN7Ojz6i8sIe-X6A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

&nbsp;<h4><em>There are limitations to the games we can add.</em></h4>
- Only browser games. Please don't ask for Fortnite or Roblox. (They can't be <em>directly</em> added, but I still add sites that contain games like those, check utilities page)
- No online multiplayer games. Since the multiplayer servers for games can and will be blocked for most people, we cannot do online multiplayer. (A
gain, I still add sites that contain games like those, check utilities page)

## Pull requests

Pull requests are highly encouraged as they take work off our hands and allow people to contribute to this site.

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>but wait, whats a pull request?!<em></h4>

> A pull request means you provide the solution to the problem you are telling us about. For example, a simple pull request could be that on line 133, a word is misspelled, so edit the code yourself to fix the misspelled word, and send in that pull request. It provides us with all added, modified, and removed lines of code. <em>Dont be adding in some sneaky viruses or something.</em> **Everything** is reviewed before commiting and pushing.
To do it, just fork the main repository on github, make the changes you think we should add to the website, and hit "create a pull request".

## repurposing
seraph is completely open source which allows you to inspect any element of the site on github, as well as being able to download assets for yourself.

*you are 100% allowed to extract games and apps from the site without any credit necessary.* (although it'd still be appreciated!). you can also change around the homepage and any other pages on the site to add or modify content and there will be no fuss from any of us.

although i dont mind not being credited, please don't just do something as simple as changing the name of the site then replacing any mentions of my name. it's an extremely scummy thing to do, especially if you claim the site as your own creation when there's a lot of effort put in behind the scenes!!

tldr; take anything game/app you want without credit!! add/modify seraph if you want, however don't replace my credit on the actual site if you can

## contributing
you can contribute to seraph in multiple ways by [raising issues on the github](https://github.com/a456pur/seraph/issues/new/choose), which can include:
- **game suggestions:** suggest games to be added to seraph! provide a link if possible to the game to make it easier to add
- **website suggestions:** suggest features to be added to the website
- **website bugs:** report bugs you are experiencing with the website (not inside a game), providing some simple steps on how to replicate the bug
- **game bugs:** report bugs that are happening during gameplay of a particular game
